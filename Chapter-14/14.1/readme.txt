14.1. Numbers Class
Design a class Numbers that can be used to translate whole dollar amounts in the range
0 through 9999 into an English description of the number. For example, the number
713 would be translated into the string seven hundred thirteen , and 8203 would be
translated into eight thousand two hundred three . The class should have a single integer
member variable:
int number;
and a static array of string objects that specify how to translate key dollar amounts
into the desired format. For example, you might use static strings such as
string lessThan20[20] = {"zero", "one", ..., "eighteen", "nineteen"};
string hundred = "hundred";
string thousand = "thousand";
The class should have a constructor that accepts a nonnegative integer and uses it to
initialize the Numbers object. It should have a member function print() that prints
the English description of the Numbers object. Demonstrate the class by writing a main
program that asks the user to enter a number in the proper range and then prints out
its English description.
