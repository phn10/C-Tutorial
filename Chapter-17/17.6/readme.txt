17.6. Member Insertion by Position
Modify the list class you created in the previous programming challenges by adding a
member function for inserting a new item at a specified position. A position of 0 means
that the value will become the first item on the list, a position of 1 means that the value
will become the second item on the list, and so on. A position equal to or greater than
the length of the list means that the value is placed at the end of the list.
