12.2. File Display Program
Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file. The program should display the
contents of the file on the screen. If the file’s contents won’t fit on a single screen, the program
should display 24 lines of output at a time, and then pause. Each time the program
pauses, it should wait for the user to strike a key before the next 24 lines are displayed.
