13. Drink Machine Simulator
Write a program that simulates a soft drink machine. The program should use a structure
that stores the following data:
Drink Name
Drink Cost
Number of Drinks in Machine
The program should create an array of five structures. The elements should be initialized
with the following data:

Drink Name    Cost     Number in Machine
Cola          .75      20
Root Beer     .75      20
Lemon-Lime    .75      20
Grape Soda    .80      20
Cream Soda    .80      20

Each time the program runs, it should enter a loop that performs the following steps:
A list of drinks is displayed on the screen. The user should be allowed to either quit the
program or pick a drink. If the user selects a drink, he or she will next enter the amount
of money that is to be inserted into the drink machine. The program should display
the amount of change that would be returned and subtract one from the number of
that drink left in the machine. If the user selects a drink that has sold out, a message
should be displayed. The loop then repeats. When the user chooses to quit the program
it should display the total amount of money the machine earned.
