9.4. Test Scores #2
Modify the program of Programming Challenge 2 to allow the user to enter name-score
pairs. For each student taking a test, the user types the student’s name followed by the
student’s integer test score. Modify the sorting function so it takes an array holding
the student names and an array holding the student test scores. When the sorted list
of scores is displayed, each student’s name should be displayed along with his or her
score. In stepping through the arrays, use pointers rather than array subscripts.
