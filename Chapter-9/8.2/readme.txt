9.2. Test Scores #1
Write a program that dynamically allocates an array large enough to hold a userdefined
number of test scores. Once all the scores are entered, the array should be
passed to a function that sorts them in ascending order. Another function should be
called that calculates the average score. The program should display the sorted list of
scores and averages with appropriate headings. Use pointer notation rather than array
notation whenever possible.
Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for test scores.
