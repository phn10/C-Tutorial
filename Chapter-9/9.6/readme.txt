6. Case Study Modification #1
Modify Program 9-19 (the United Cause case study program) so it can be used with
any set of donations. The program should dynamically allocate the donations array
and ask the user to input its values.
7. Case Study Modification #2
Modify Program 9-19 (the United Cause case study program) so the arrptr array is
sorted in descending order instead of ascending order.
